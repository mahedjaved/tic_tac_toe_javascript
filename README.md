# tic_tac_toe_javascript
Just a basic practice code for making a tic-tac-toe with JS, HTML and CSS
The main file "thirdPartyIndex.html" needs to be specifically run in Edge web engine
The files labelled 'OLD' are former trial at the code, these were unsuccessful and
hence were removed, they do contain a more detailed and well commented code BTW
